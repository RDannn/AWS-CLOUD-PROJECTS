# AWS-CLOUD-PROJECTS

Welcome to my GitHub, where I document my hands-on journey in AWS cloud architecture, building solutions with serverless, scalable, and secure designs.

Overview

🌩️ What is AWS and Cloud Computing?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides on-demand IT resources and services such as computing power, storage, and databases, all available over the internet. Cloud computing itself allows businesses to access these resources remotely, eliminating the need for owning physical hardware, while providing scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. By leveraging the cloud, organizations can rapidly deploy and manage applications in a more secure, reliable, and efficient manner.

🚀 My AWS Cloud Journey

This repository is a collection of projects developed as part of my learning journey in AWS cloud architecture. These projects were created through a series of hands-on labs, where I applied various AWS services to build, deploy, and manage cloud solutions.

🔸The projects demonstrate my ability to integrate multiple AWS services, including but not limited to:

🔸Serverless architectures using AWS Lambda and API Gateway

🔸Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK

🔸Storage solutions with Amazon S3 and DynamoDB

🔸Monitoring and management using AWS CloudWatch and AWS IAM for security best practices

These hands-on experiences have been instrumental in solidifying my understanding of AWS cloud architecture, helping me design, implement, and maintain scalable solutions. While the journey has been challenging, it has enriched my knowledge of cloud computing, and I have learned invaluable skills in designing real-world solutions. This knowledge is foundational as I work towards my goal of becoming a Cloud Engineer or Solutions Architect.

✈️ Real-World Application: Airline Use Case

To demonstrate the practical application of these skills, I have built a series of cloud solutions using the example of an airline company. In this scenario, I designed and deployed cloud-based architectures to solve real-world problems such as:

🔹Handling flight reservations using serverless APIs and managed databases

🔹Managing passenger data with secure, scalable storage solutions

🔹Real-time monitoring and analytics for flight statuses using AWS CloudWatch and Lambda functions

🔹Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance by utilizing AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling

These projects reflect how I leverage AWS services to design scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud solutions, showcasing the expertise I’ve gained throughout my cloud journey.


Each project in this repository represents a well-designed architecture, with all components working in harmony to deliver a fully functional solution. All architectures and code are deployed in development environments, allowing for real-world testing and refinement during my studies.


Each project includes:

🔘Detailed architecture diagrams

🔘Full codebase with Infrastructure as Code scripts

🔘Deployment instructions

🔘Notes on challenges, solutions, and lessons learned

Feel free to explore the repository and dive into each project to see how AWS services are used to build scalable, reliable, and efficient cloud solutions! 💻☁️
